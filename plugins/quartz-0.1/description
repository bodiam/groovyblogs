This plugin adds Quartz job scheduling features to Grails application.

Quartz plugin allows your Grails application to schedule jobs to be
executed using a specified interval or cron expression. The underlying
system uses the Quartz Enterprise Job Scheduler configured via Spring,
but is made simpler by the coding by convention paradigm.
